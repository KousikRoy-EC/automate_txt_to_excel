1. **The Binary Castle**
   
   Problem: In the kingdom of Binaryland, castles are represented by 1's and empty land by 0's. The king wants to know the size of the largest castle. A castle is a group of connected 1's (horizontally or vertically).
   
   Example:
   Input: 
   ```
   1 0 1 1
   1 1 0 1
   1 0 0 1
   ```
   Output: 4
   
   Constraints:
   - 1 ≤ matrix size ≤ 1000
   - Matrix elements are either 0 or 1

   Hint: Consider using depth-first search (DFS) to explore connected components.

2. **The Recursive Staircase**

   Problem: Young Tim loves to climb stairs. He can climb either 1 or 2 steps at a time. Given a staircase of n steps, help Tim count how many different ways he can reach the top.

   Example:
   Input: n = 4
   Output: 5 (1+1+1+1, 1+1+2, 1+2+1, 2+1+1, 2+2)

   Constraints:
   - 1 ≤ n ≤ 45

   Hint: Think about how the solution for n steps relates to the solutions for (n-1) and (n-2) steps.
