## The Binary Bakery

Problem: At the Binary Bakery, cakes are arranged in a binary pattern. Given the number of cakes, find the number of complete rows in the arrangement.

Example:
Input: n = 5
Output: 2

Constraints:
1 <= n <= 2^31 - 1

```python
def arrange_cakes(n: int) -> int:
    # Implement your solution here
    pass
```

Error hint: Be careful with integer overflow when calculating the square root.

##  Recursion in the Library

Problem: In a library, books are arranged recursively. Each shelf contains books and may contain smaller shelves. Count the total number of books.

Example:
Input: library = [1, [2, [3, 4], 5], [6, 7]]
Output: 7

Constraints:
1 <= number of elements <= 1000
1 <= book number <= 10000

```python
def count_books(library: list) -> int:
    # Implement your solution here
    pass
```

Error hint: Remember to handle both integers and lists in your recursive function.
